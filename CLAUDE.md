## Installation & Setup

Agents are installed to `~/.claude/agents/` and become available immediately in Claude Code sessions.

```bash
# Install all agents
./install-agents.sh

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/agents/

# Start using (in Claude Code conversation)
"Use the Will subagent to define requirements for my app"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Agent not found**: Verify installation with `ls ~/.claude/agents/`
- **Unexpected behavior**: Check agent configuration in respective `.md` file
- **Permission issues**: Ensure proper file permissions after installation

### Getting Help
- Use Diego for debugging agent behavior issues
- Consult Marcus for questions about agent code quality standards
- Reference individual agent files in `.claude/agents/` for detailed capabilities

## Contributing

When contributing to agent configurations:
1. Follow existing agent file structure and conventions
2. Test agent behavior thoroughly across different scenarios  
3. Update documentation to reflect any capability changes
4. Ensure consistent naming and formatting standards

## Security Considerations

- Agent configurations are stored locally in `~/.claude/agents/`
- No sensitive data should be included in agent files
- Use Sarah for security reviews of any agent modifications
- Regular security audits recommended for production usage
