## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in AI Team Alpha, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@your-org.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Private Issue**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact project maintainers directly

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Security Considerations

#### Agent Configuration Security

- Agent configuration files are plain text and should not contain sensitive information
- Never include API keys, passwords, or tokens in agent configurations
- Review agent instructions for potential prompt injection vulnerabilities

#### Installation Security

- The `install-agents.sh` script should be reviewed before execution
- Only install agents from trusted sources
- Verify script integrity using checksums when available

#### Runtime Security

- Claude Code agents operate within Claude's security sandbox
- Agents cannot execute arbitrary code on your system
- All interactions are logged and auditable

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Source Verification**: Only install agents from official repositories
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep agents updated to latest versions
3. **Review Changes**: Review agent configuration changes before applying
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to agent configuration files
5. **Backup**: Maintain backups of custom agent configurations

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security issues will be disclosed publicly only after fixes are available
- We will credit security researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Critical vulnerabilities will be disclosed with patches simultaneously
