## 🎨 Agent Customization

Each agent can be customized by editing their respective `.md` files in `.claude/agents/`:

- **Model**: All agents use `sonnet` by default
- **Colors**: Each agent has a unique color for UI differentiation
- **Tools**: Specific tool access per agent role
- **Behavior**: Custom instructions and workflows

## 🤝 Best Practices

### When to Use Each Agent

- **Use Will** when you need clear requirements, user stories, or feature prioritization
- **Use Mike** for architectural decisions, technology choices, or system design
- **Use Sarah** for security reviews, compliance, or threat analysis  
- **Use Luke** for any development work across web, mobile, or backend
- **Use Alex** for infrastructure, deployment, or DevOps tasks
- **Use Vijay** for testing strategies, test creation, or QA processes
- **Use Marcus** after writing code for quality and security review
- **Use Diego** when encountering errors, bugs, or unexpected behavior
- **Use Elena** for data analysis, SQL queries, or database insights

### Workflow Tips

1. **Start with planning** - Use Will and Mike before development
2. **Security first** - Involve Sarah early for sensitive features
3. **Test continuously** - Use Vijay throughout development, not just at the end
4. **Review regularly** - Use Marcus after significant code changes
5. **Debug proactively** - Use Diego when tests fail or errors occur
